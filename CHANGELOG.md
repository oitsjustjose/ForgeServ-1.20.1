## 1.0.2

### Added:

- Emojis from ForgeServ to Emojiful ðŸ‘Œ
- Flux Networks
- Luggage
- NotEnoughCrashes

### Fixed:

- Fixed Delightful Salmonberries generating, but those you've obtained or found already won't say "Disabled" anymore
- Fixed Quark "disabling" mending - this isn't Harmonious Magineering
- Hopefully fixed the Glass recipe conflict - also added a Blasting recipe to make glass even faster to craft
- Increased Diamond frequency in Mining Dimension
- Reduced Clay frequency in Mining Dimension
- Silver and other materials not being able to be crafted into various storage blocks
- Some blocks not being mineable by the Spectral Hammer
- Bad REI performance - should be much quicker to look up recipes and uses, as well as no longer have to wait for REI to load before opening it

### Changed:

- MiniUtilities' Quantum Quarry has been permantly nuked in this pack. In my testing, it caused a **permanent** crash to the world that never resolved, locking me out of the world forever. I don't want that happening to us pls.

## 1.0.1

### Changed

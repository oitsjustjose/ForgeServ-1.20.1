## 1.0.3

### Added:

- Aether + Aether Redux + Deep Aether
- Angel Ring
- Building Gadgets
- Colytra
- JEI
- Just Enough Calculation
- Nature's Compass
- Structure Compass
- Custom Patchouli book for TechReborn to help newcomers
- Script to give users an extra Charm slot to help with keeping their Enigmatic Charm on at all times, in place of having a grave mod.

### Removed:

- Dimensional Threading
  - Broke Hyperboxes
- MiniUtilities
  - Holy crap was this mod broken. I disabled Ender Ore but it didn't acknowledge that config choice, and we've now discovered horrendous dupe bugs and outright negligence with the Golden Lassos.
- REI
  - Literally a bad mod for this pack with the number of crashes and lag spikes it caused - TechReborn machines won't show their recipes anymore, but I've generated a bunch of JEI "Info" pages for each item that vaguely tell you what you need to craft things and in which machine.

### Fixed:

- InventoryProfiles sometimes causing a crash when moving too many items to your Backpack too quickly (I know Jake had this one a _lot_)

## 1.0.2

### Added:

- BadWitherNoCookie
- Emojis from ForgeServ to Emojiful 👌
- Flux Networks
- Luggage
- BotanyPots support for RegionsUnexplored

### Updated:

- Dungeon: Now Loading 1%
- Explorify
- Framed Blocks
- PacketFixer

### Fixed:

- Bad REI performance - should be much quicker to look up recipes and uses, as well as no longer have to wait for REI to load before opening it
- Fixed Delightful Salmonberries generating, but those you've obtained or found already won't say "Disabled" anymore
- Fixed Quark "disabling" mending - this isn't Harmonious Magineering
- Hopefully fixed the Glass recipe conflict - also added a Blasting recipe to make glass even faster to craft
- Increased Diamond frequency in Mining Dimension
- Reduced Clay frequency in Mining Dimension
- Silver and other materials not being able to be crafted into various storage blocks
- Some blocks not being mineable by the Spectral Hammer

### Changed:

- MiniUtilities' Quantum Quarry has been permantly nuked in this pack. In my testing, it caused a **permanent** crash to the world that never resolved, locking me out of the world forever. I don't want that happening to us pls.

## 1.0.1

### Added

- Advanced Peripherals
- Eccentric Tome
- ExtraSounds

### Removed

- Thermal Cultivation (Overlap w/ Farmer's Delight was too damn high)

### Changed

- Recipes from Framed Compacting Drawers
- Recipes from Expanded Storage
- Recipes from DimStorage

### Fixed

- Plenty of recipe conflicts - there are still _some_, but they've been greatly reduced.
- Removed overlapping gear from Tools' Complement (namely Silver & Bronze)
